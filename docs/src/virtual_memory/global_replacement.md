# Global Replacement

A global replacement policy considers all unlocked pages in main memory as candidates for replacement, regardless of which process owns a particular page.

## Working Set Strategy

* Working Set: The working set with parameter $\Delta$ for a process at virtual time $t$, which we designate as $W(t, \Delta)$, is the set of pages of that process that have been referenced in the last $\Delta$ virtual time units.

* Resident Set:
