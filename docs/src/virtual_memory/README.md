# Virtual Memory

We now move to a discussion of virtual memory. An analysis of this topic is complicated by the fact that memory management is a complex interrelationship between processor hardware and operating system software. We will focus first on the hardware aspect of virtual memory, looking at the use of paging, segmentation, and combined paging and segmentation. Then we will look at the issues involved in the design of a virtual memory facility in operating systems.
